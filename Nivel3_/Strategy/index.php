//Â¿question?
// According to the previous considerations, 
// we need to use the strategy pattern so that given the make of a car, 
// our program calculates the discount.

// Make sure to keep the following in mind:

// You need to create a function called addSeasonDiscount that adds a discount when sales drop.
// You need to create a function called addStockDiscount that adds a discount when the inventory is too large.
// Since coupons vary depending on the type of car, 
// it would be ideal to call these functions in separate classes. 
// Therefore, it will be necessary to implement the classes bmwCuoponGenerator and mercedesCuoponGenerator.

// In fact, as the previous methods for each coupon have the same name; 
// it is necessary to create the carCouponGenerator interface 
// that forces all classes that implement it to use them, 
// including the ones we just wrote and those we would like to add in the future.

// Print the 
//coupon result for the two car brands (BMW and Mercedes) on the screen.
